# To-do app
This is the most basic version of a to-do app. It can store various to-do list items and various actions can be done to them.

## Features
The to-do app has three main features.
### Add
This allows the user to add their various items. Blank or empty items are not acccepted and the user will be met with an error upon empty entries.

### Edit
This allows a user to edit an already existing list item in amodal box. They can then save or cancel the changes and it will be reflected accordingly.

### Delete
In the case of a list item that the user doesn't want anymore they have the ability to delete it and remove it entirely from their list of undone items.

### Done
THis allows a user to mark any listed to-do done to show that they have completed the task. The task will then be moved to the done section for the viewer to atleast be able to visualize what hey have finished.

### Technologies used.
This app is a very basic react app with toastify used for the alerts.
